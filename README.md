# Introduction to Diffusion (SGM and Heat Method)

## Score-based Generative Model (SGM)
Get started with the basic of SGM in the `HelloScore.ipynb`. When you're done, feel free to use the 
modularized code in `ScoreUtils` directory to build and experiment with your own score-based model!
More examples on how to use this can be found in `SGMinTheWild.py`.
